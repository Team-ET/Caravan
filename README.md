## Caravan

The ability to give free-spirited people the means to roam and explore the globe with like-minded individuals.

## Motivation

There are tons of travel apps out there about booking trips, but none of them book people.  Caravan gives you the ability to book and plan your trip with a group of like minded people that you share personality traits with.  The adventure of traveling and making new friends is what Caravan brings to the table.

## Features

Caravan uses IBM Watson in order to get your personality traits.  From their you can see others personality traits and compare your traits to group averages to match with groups with similar traits.  Create your own group and chat with other users.  After your trip upload your photos and create your own photo library.
